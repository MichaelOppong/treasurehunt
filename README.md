### 1) While logged into github, go to https://github.com/new to create a new repository. You shouldn't have to change any of the default settings, just give it a name and continue

### 2) On the next step, click "Import Code"

### 8) Don't forget to hit commit changes at the bottom of the page. It takes about a minute for the site to refresh but if you go to your website now it should be updated with your changes.
